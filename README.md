Emulated EEPROM based on STM32 application note AN3969 (eeprom emulation with wear leveling)

Code base is taken from EEPROM library of Maple STM32F1 Core (https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32) to support STM32F4. Last two flash memory sectors are used for EEPROM emulation.  
Tested on STM32F411.
